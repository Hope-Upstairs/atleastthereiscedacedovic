Čeda:
'The Balkan Menace'
Origin: Poor 4
Role: Killer

The protagonist of our story.

Čeda is a connoisseur and lover of War, Death, Suffering, Guns and Sharp Weaponry. Most people have described him as "The worst slav humanity has to offer" or "The opposite of a Human." He does not hate humanity, he just loves the worst aspects of it. He Started at least 5 world wars, as well as help spark numerous smaller wars. An example would be him helping start the Mrioslav Warz (with a Z instead of S), a sort of civil war between people who are naked when taking a shower, and people who keep their clothes on when taking a shower. Due to this war, Čeda, Andre and Djole (with Djole being the leader and commander), temporarily had to fight their own friend, Miroslav, and his army of Miroslavs. After Djole and his gang won, they all made up, with Čeda telling Miroslav to "Stop being a Pussy", after killing him. He is also the only known slav in recorded history to be powerful enough to defeat his own babushka. And then once he did that, he went to the afterlife and killed her again, making her super dead, we're not sure how he returned to the land of the living.
This one time, he also kicked a soccer ball so hard that it burst a hole through the goalie. He also decapitated a local fisherman, destroyed a submarine, picked up the Titanic and threw it a million miles, with only being able to hear a split second of screaming from the passengers. He would also regularly use his invention, "The Čeda Doll", to blow everything up. Pretty sure one time he blew up about 30% of Europe by doing this. Not to mention that Čeda's kill count is so high that the reason people celebrate birthdays is because it's a challenge to survive a whole year without getting killed by him. Due to all these horrible feats, he has gained the powers of a great warrior, and that has evolved him into a Superbeing like his other three friends.
This brings us to current events, Čeda wanting power over Counter Strike, which would give him the ability to rule over all of slav kind. He gleefully enters his favourite place in the whole wide world, Hell, but is quickly disappointed to see that there are no poor souls in pain or being tortured in various cruel ways. Instead he is saddened to find out that Hell has become infected by a Supervirus simply known as 'Meme', transforming the once dark fiery Hades into Meme Hell. The edgy Superbeing mourns as he is on his quest to kill Mega Satan and his army and become the new king of Counter Strike. Though throughout the journey he can't help but feel like he could also stop the meme infection. But he believes with the help of his friends back at home, and with him becoming powerful enough to overthrow Mega Satan and take over Counter Strike, he may have the skills and power needed to overcome whatever is in the nucleus of the Meme disease and kill it, stopping the spread of the horrible meme.

Djole:
'In-Depth Stupidity'
Origin: Poor 4
Role: Bad at School

Djole is the host of his own game show, which you don't get to participate in, but he likes Golden Sausages.
Nobody knows for sure of the legend of Djole. He could have been born many many years ago, like Andre. Or he could have been a normal boy turned into a Superbeing like Čeda or Miroslav. He seems to say things and perform actions regularly that Čeda has described before as "Idiotic". However, despite his regular silly dialogue, no one is quite sure if he has the power of supernatural stupidity, or if his intelligence is so superior that we just don't understand it and pass it off as him being dumb. Sometimes he claims things, and they more often than not end up being true, no matter how outlandish it is. Because of this, when he says things in class like: "Oh, I know Abraham Lincoln, that was the bitch who ate my newspapers. I was at his funeral yesterday." We're not sure if he's talking out of his ass, or if that really happened (Djole got 12 Fs in school that day).
Due to his perplexing knowledge and insanity, he has earned himself a spot among the Great Old ones, among other great ones such as Cthulhu and good ol' Sfatlicllp. Though he fears no mortal man, the one being that he is afraid of is Tinky Winky. He believes that Tinky Winky is the only being he is unable to comprehend, much like how we cannot understand Djole. Tinky Winky, being the powerful being that he is, attacks by detaching his arm and throwing it at his enemies and that's it, after that he can't do anything else.
Djole has the ability to sing, but his main power is to be always happy. Djole also was the one to discover Dribbling Trading Cards, which ended the Ancient Era, and started the Middle Era. Much like the other Poor 4 members, he also has a hobby of scooba-diving in lava to find hidden artefacts. One time, while swimming through lava during the Pompeii disaster, he was able to find a living breathing Augustus Caesar, he then threw it back when Čeda told him to put it away, because it could contaminate the food they brought.

Andre:
'Planet turned Human'
Origin: Poor 4
Role: Large Boy

Andre is a friend who likes to eat Sausages, Golden ones are even better.
Andre is an immortal being born millions of years ago, theorized to be the oldest member of the Poor 4. Unlike some of the others, Andre was not a human turned into a Superbeing. He was first a very small, grey planet, turned into a real human as some kind of stupid joke. With this he has turned into a gluttonous boy who enjoys to eat to the point where he had become a master chef, so that he could eat more. He even beat his rival, Luke Cage, at a cooking contest. Most of his existence he has spent screaming for millions of years, no real reason, he just wanted to. He stopped when Čeda punched him in the face and was introduced to the other Poor 4 members, at which point they have become good friends.
Andre even gained various interests besides just food, such as Japanese manga and anime, flaming bazooka cannons that shoot flaming coca cola cans that are on fire and installing multiple copies of Croc: Legend of the Gobos on his PC several dozen times. He also has the power to turn into Coral reef. Andre is one of the most powerful beings in the Poor 4 universe, but chooses to be fairly pacifistic, some feats of power include creating Flaming Coca Cola and storing a universe in his stomach. He also permanently stopped the war between people who prefer using fighter jets and tanks, by simply eating all tanks and fighter jets, and making them give up, and resort to using horses. This event was what caused the beginning of the "Ancient Era". Another thing Andre created, though by accident, are a new species of humans called "Bolid". These beings were a result of a failed experiment to create humans that could reproduce asexually like amoebas, but instead created humans that are able to phase through walls and objects.

Miroslav:
'Quarter Spider'
Origin: Poor 4
Role: Army Leader

Miroslav is the leader and commander of his own Miroslav Army. He uses Golden Sausages to pay his army because they have a good exchange rate.
Miroslav was once a boy, but then one day he got bit by a radioactive Spiderman. And because of this he was transformed into a Half-Human Half-Spiderman Superbeing. With his new-found powers, he is able to shoot all sorts of blins from his hands. However, all of these blins are deadly, and simply touching them will turn you into a built-in Macromedia Flash 8 explosion effect. Miroslav and his army are faithful worshippers of the god MirMan, one of many powerful gods of the Poor 4 universe, such as Tinky Winky, Vince Collins and the Anti-Crust.
He is also a famous mid-2000s rapper, as you can tell by the fact that you can't understand anything he's saying, and that he sounds like he's perpetually about to cry, his stage name is Miro de Niro. In his free time he develops blin related weaponry to equip his army, so that one day he can battle against Winnie the Pooh. This one time he sold his entire Miroslav army for an internet connection to play Counter Strike 1.6, he spent a long time re populating his army into what it was again. Miroslav is able to create new Miroslav soldiers through Miroslav Larva.
Being the powerful general, he was able to invent a brand new strategy that revolutionised war and combat as we know it. His idea was to not use weapons, not even hand to hand combat. Instead he would take advantage of the environment around him in fights, by regularly picking up rocks and trees and throwing them at his enemies, obliterating them. This technique has since become outdated, as simply shooting the enemy with a gun was much more convenient and was effective no matter the environment. Even Miroslav has abandoned his own fighting style in favour of just throwing deadly blins at his enemies. This new revolution in combat has marked the end of the "Middle Era" and started the "New Era"
Later, in the Modern Era, World War 3 started because nobody could agree what Shaggy was saying in his song "It wasn't Me" featuring RikRok. However, Miroslav was able to end the war. Thanks to his incomprehensible speech, he was able to accurately translate the songs lyrics.

Klempodrome had a fierce battle with Corn Man in the sea sides of Greece, but was able to defeat him by using his signature attack of flopping his massive ears, to cause strong wind currents. These winds would gather nearby leafs and make them sharp enough to cut flesh, and was able to defeat Corn Man.
His quest ended when he drove a Ghost Bus, which was haunted by the Emo Ghost, sent out by MirMan to stop Klempodrome. The Emo Ghost managed to crash the bus, leaving Klempodrome fatally injured, in a last ditch effort, he pledges alliance with the mighty MirMan, to save his own life, but in exchange he will serve Miroslav whenever he needs help.

A mighty warrior from the north, who has defeated the evil sorcerer Drax. However, no matter how evil the wizard was, the barbarian still killed him, which automatically granted him a spot in hell no matter the context. While there, he has become noticeably more detailed looking, but more badly coded. While he is no stranger to bravery, he's no stranger to fear either, he knows when to back off from a fight when he can see that there is a warrior that's greater than him, and will attempt to escape, but that doesn't mean he won't fight back. It is said that he is a warrior of both the Java Jungle and the Flash Lands.

Lizardman
'He likes Coca-Cola'
Origin: Poor 4
Role: Nemesis

He is Čeda's greatest nemesis, but while he does exist in the poor 4 realm, he is, in-fact, omnipresent. He is a being that simultaneously exists in every universe that has Coca Cola. As long as there is Coca Cola, there is Lizardman, and that's a problem. Because he can never be truly killed, as long as there is Coca Cola, Lizardman will live, which is exactly why Čeda despises him. He is the only enemy he's ever encounter that he could never truly kill. And even if he does kill him in this universe by getting rid of all traces of Coca Cola, he'll just exist in another universe where Coca Cola kept existing.
The day Lizardman and Čeda solidified their rivalry was when Lizardman was trying to cause a flood in a store, to flush out all the coca cola. However, his plan was ruined when Čeda came into the store and simply destroyed it, along with all the Coca Cola. Lizardman curses Čeda and his desire to kill and destroy, getting in his way of getting more Coca Cola, to which Čeda only says "I don't give shit". Lizardman is also the owner of the first Stick Man, which is frozen in a block of ice. He regularly gets visitors to see the historical display, which he uses the profits to buy more Coca Cola.
in the events of this game, he has gained the powers of shape-shifting, being able to turn into various creepypasta beings.

Mega Stalin & Nuclear Throne
'The Dynamic Duo'
Origin: Ryab gets Grounded
Role: Right-hand Men

A rag-tag duo of villains, who have been informing the current king of Hell of your progress, as well they are the ones that have been building all the traps and obstacles in the unfinished Final World, a world specifically created as a final defence against Čeda's invasion. They created the world out of pieces of youtube videos. With the leadership skills of Mega Stalin and the deadly radioactive attacks of Nuclear Throne, they make for a dangerous last resort for the ruler of Hell.
It is theorized that Mega Stalin and Nuclear Throne worked with GoAnimate Gods, which include Dora the Explorer, PC Guy, Caillou and Mega Satan. Together they would invent a Web Browser Program back then called "GoAnimate", and along with it the concept of "Grounding". GoAnimatologists have been debating the definition of "Grounding", as well as the state of being known as "Dead Meat", to this very day. The creation of GoAnimate has brought the start of the Cult of the Groundead, a new art movement, 3% increase in taxes related to sales of white flour, as well as the end of the "New Era" and the start of the current "Modern Era".

Mega Satan
'Big Bad'
Origin: Ryab gets Grounded
Role: Ruler of Hell

Worshipped by the Cult of the Groundead, he is a mighty and powerful being, who's immense power was able to dethrone Satan from his icy throne. With his overwhelming powers, the creature was declared as Mega Satan, with Satan having no choice but to pursuit a career in skate-boarding. With a new ruler comes new policies, which lead him to discontinue the management and containment of the meme disease that radiates from the Meme Core. Legally, he's also obliged to be the king of Counter Strike as well, which comes with many benefits, such as having his layer surrounded by a defensive fortress to keep away any slav boys from barging in and killing the ruler of hell. Due to his decision to discontinue the containment of the meme disease, the only way to stop it is to kill the source. This core of the meme disease can only be accessed by eating all four slices of the mysterious apple artefact.
Mega Satan is portrayed differently across many cultures, but commonly it is depicted as a Giant Head and a pair of Giant Hands, controlling and summoning various beings to fight for him and saying "This is mah shot". According to prophesies, the rapper "50 Cents" will one day in the close future (2012) use his powerful magic to resurrect Mega Satan as well as 2000s Crunk Music. Once this happens, Mega Satan will send out his daughter, the Anti-Crust, to start a war with Zigzag. The War will consist of 7 battles in total, with each battle breaking a seal. With each seal being broken introduces some new bullshit into the world, such as "Stick figure VS Door" , "Lord jpeg" and "Turbo Folk". The end of this war will mark the end of the "Modern Era" and the start of the "Future Era".

MariObama
'Dead Meme'
Origin: MariObama
Role: Patient Zero

A not so forgotten Demi-God who's rot influences the entirety of hell. He is the core of the meme disease, and is the one responsible for it's spread across hell. Due to being enveloped in the meme disease for years and years of isolation, he has become one of the strongest beings in the underworld. However, one thing he has in common with Čeda, is that he too can use the same powerups that Čeda has been using throughout his journey. However, not only is he able to gain any of the powerups he wants at will, but he in general has mastered them to the point of near perfection, making full use of them and creating some difficult attacks to dodge.
Legends say that MariObama was a human living on the surface of Earth, as president of the United States. However, the looming fear of what's known as "The Mandatory Government Sponsored UnElection Day" (MGSUD) has lead him to the path of madness, as he changed into a Mario outfit and went down a pipe leading into Hell. In his delusional mind, this is him finally retaliating against "UnElection Day", but in actuality, he just started the spread of the meme disease. Using a Rage Comic template and a PNG of the Awesome Face, he transformed all of hell into what's now known as "Meme-Hell". The spread of the disease was temporary halted by Satan, but once he was dethroned, and Mega Satan took his place, it resumed to spread for years. New landmarks and cities were formed from this conversion, such as Skeleton Las Vegas, Vince World, and the famous Jelly Gang Hideout. He claims that this all started when he accidentally took a dragon's tie, thinking it was his own, which held immeasurable powers and was what caused both his insanity and the meme disease. His goal was to go back in time to kill George Washington to restore everything back to normal, and over the few years he's been in hell, he was unable to achieve this goal. With this failure, he spent the rest of his days in his hideout inside the Meme Core, wishing to one day get his real tie back.
While going throughout meme hell he would find himself in many terrible journeys. One of which has him meet up with two gentlemen, one of which he saw the bare ass of in the space bathroom. It is widely believed this adventure in particular finally broke him and lead to him going mad, but that validity of that claim is up in the air.
It is unknown what will exactly happen to Hell once MariObama is killed, the meme disease eradicated and Čeda as the new ruler. The Council of Tortured Souls speculate that Hell will be in a weird inbetween of it's past self and it's Meme Hell version , while others believe that Hell will simply adapt to the surrounding lands in 'The Afterlife' as a whole, ultimately making it less radically different from the rest.
-
Trashbug
'Living Garbage'
Origin: Original
Role: Cannon fodder

A very common being found within Hell. It's only goal is to scout all corners of hell. Because of this, they seem fairly adaptable to their environment and have a high resistance to the meme disease.
Their role in hell seems to be that of hell's prison guards. While the souls of the damned take the form of brick blocks it seems, the Trashbugs seems to be the prison wardens, if you will, keeping all the souls in-check and torturing them. Though many have brought this claim into question due to them not being very threatening to common people, or even brick blocks for that matter.
-
Trashfly
'When Garbage Flies'
Origin: Original
Role: Flying Fodder

A different breed of Trashbug. These creatures' job is to patrol the skies of hell. Even though they have flight, they do not like moving away too far from their original position. It seems that these trashbugs have developed wings out of necessity, as they are usually seen floating above hazards and bottomless pits.
-
Skeleton
'Spine Chillers'
Origin: Real Life
Role: Body Support

They come in many shapes and sizes. Many of these types of skeletons like to stay in concrete pipes, but some of them, like the rib cages, can survive out in the open just fine, though in their case they cannot move either. Some skeletons can also shoot bone projectiles that hurt you. Although if the skeletons do come out of the pipes, standing near the pipes will prevent them from popping back up until you are further away.
-
Slav Cannon
'The Gopnik Passtime'
Origin: Slav Technology
Role: Big Gun

A weapon of mass slavness, it is used to launch Water Bottles. These projectiles, while deadly, move fairly slowly and can even be stomped on for extra hight. Really it helps more than it harms all things considered.
These weapons were once used by gopniks in their free time as a social activity, until they were weaponized by the hell military.
-
Mixtapes
'Nutritious Songs'
Origin: Original
Role: CD Case

A somewhat common being that is a living CD Case, that carries a disc in itself. It's about as intelligent as the common Trashbug, but when being stomped on, it'll retract into the disc it was carrying to avoid further damage. Although a clever thought, the disc can be easily eaten for powerups.
Yes, that's right, these discs can give you powerups, with different abilities depending on which color the disc is. The blue ones give you the equivalent of a regular flaming coca cola can, while the yellow and red ones give you more powerful cheese and axe powerups.
-
Spikeys
'The Sorcerer's Spawn'
Origin: Original
Role: Walking Hazard

A mutation of the Trashbug, due to how rather fast Trashbugs can adapt to their environment, these Trashbugs are usually seen in colder areas of hell, and have also developed spikes on their backs to fend off predators. They can also be summoned by Mad Sorcerers, making your trip across some obstacle a lot more tricky.
-
Mad Sorcerer
'Wanted'
Origin: Bubble Bobble Nostalgie
Role: Area Control

An evil cultist that stays on his cloud and throws spiky ice balls at you. These spiky balls then turn into Spikeys on impact with the ground. This being was actually present in hell even before the Meme Plague from 4 years ago, only suffering defeat at the claws of two small dragons, trapping him in a large bubbles.
-
Trashbee
'Sweet Garbage'
Origin: Original
Role: Aerial Fodder

A slight variation of the Trashfly creature. It is most commonly found in calmer green areas, because they think they are bees and can pollinate flowers. Due to living in generally less harsh environments, they are weaker than regular Trashflies.
They wear glasses due to being near-sighted. A strange mouse child was sick of these bees flying into his balloons, so he personally took it upon himself to equip every single Trashbee with a pair of glasses to help them see better.
-
Lumpy
'Blue and Blissful'
Origin: HTF: Spin Fun
Role: Moose

Nothing special, just your average master of the park merry-go-round. A moose who's spent years of his life training the art of the roundabout, to the point where he can spin so fast that his infinite supply of small and somewhat fragile animal friends are launched into the distance. The more these animals are injured the more points Lumpy gets, as he sits in one place launching his friends to their demise. Unfortunately, due to Čeda being hard to see in the distance, Lumpy confuses him for a weird moving sideways spike trap, and thus will attempt to constantly throw his friends at you. While dangerous, avoiding these animals is as simple as staying under a roof, or even just continuously running, just don't stop moving until you find some cover.
-
Space Ship
'Space Conga'
Origin: Space Impact
Role: Line of Defence

A line of small spaceships that follow you vertically to try and block your path forward. For a spaceship they don't seem to be able to fire any lasers or projectiles at you, so that's very odd. While they used to roam space, they have been banished to hell for space-crime reasons.
They seem to come from some kind of strange crab looking mothership, which resides in a cave like environment. Nobody has been able to find the mothership, with only a single photo available of the location taken by a fallen spacecraft.
-
Fugo
'Poison Cheese'
Origin: jojo
Role: Cheese Bro

An Anime boy who for whatever reason is wearing a suit that makes him look like cheese. They fire a deadly purple-tinted cheese ball that doesn't quite evaporate it's victims, but is certainly enough to hurt them. How there are so many copies of him all around hell is a mystery. In addition, rumours say that they have a secret power that can really slow you down if you're unlucky enough to see it on your journey.
-
Ghost Dancer
'He, he, wanna wawate'
Origin: Castlevania 10
Role: Bouncer

Mysterious spirits of the castle, seeming to be in a perpetual seizure, they are actually just dancing very quickly. They dance so quickly, in fact, that they are able to produce so much momentum to the point where they are able to fly and bounce around in rooms, though they don't have much control over their direction.
-
Dinosaur?
'I don't think that's a Dinosaur'
Origin: Cable Capers 2
Role: Tank?

A fast creature that come from the depths of the mines. It's not enough to just stomp on them once, for they will just be squished and start moving even faster than usual. It seems that the mine they originated from was originally on the surface of earth before collapsing into hell due to flood damage. It seems that these creatures were the only living things found in the mines, the only other things that were found in there are some laser turrets, elevators and somehow still working lights.
-
Sea Urchin
'Wall Hugging Hazard'
Origin: Real Life
Role: Block Hazard

The Sea Urchins of hell are a bit different than the regular ones me and you know of in the real world. For one, they do not just stand in one place, but rather, they move on the floor, and also, they hurt you pretty badly. It is said that Andre created these Sea Urchins out of his own flesh, before throwing them away into an abyss. There's no particular reason why, he just kind of did it.
-
Starship 7
'Leisure Shuttle'
Origin: Starship Eleven
Role: Aerial Denial

An easy ship to pilot, as a defence system, instead of having some kind of forcefield or armor, it instead has drills rotate it to fend off anyone that tries to stomp on them, thought most of the time they still have an opening in their defences. They also seem to have the engine of a LaserTank Mk. 4.1.2. so when the engine fails it makes almost the same noise as when a Laser Tank is destroyed.
-
Ethernet Climber
'Jestem Hardkorem'
Origin: Old Polish Meme
Role: Hardcore Man

A hardcore climbing enthusiast, he climbs on an ethernet cable and throws the most hardcore weapon of all, a hammer. Due to Čeda not being nearly as hardcore, he himself cannot climb the ethernet cables that these climbers roam on. They seem to have warm suits on even at warm climates, presumably to better protect their identity to avoid any trouble with the hell cops.
-
Construction Worker
'Paint the town Yellow'
Origin: Building Panic
Role: Builder

This shady man probably has connections with the Japanese mafia, in fact, he probably is part of the mafia. Aside from that his hardhat makes you unable to kill him by stomping on him, and he can shoot a projectile which upon hitting a surface can form into a plaster cube.
He and many others used to torment some guy on various construction sites, but stopped after he killed most of them by brutally shooting plaster in their face, I guess that's their weakness.
-
Ghost
'Grew another Eye'
Origin: Bubble Bobble Nostalgie
Role: Fear

Very evil creatures that cannot be killed (by most methods). With the influence of the meme infection, it has grown arms and a second eye. With their newly found depth perception, they realised that people are looking at them and thus have become shy. So whenever Čeda looks at them, he gets a good chance to escape them. They used to be trapped in some sort of hour glass but something happened during the meme infection that freed them from their glassy prison.
-
Yeet
'Dimension Hopper'
Origin: Boppin'
Role: Cool Guy

No, I'm not kidding, it's name is actually Yeet. We're not making a "haha late 2010s meme lol". No, his name is actually fucking YEET. I swear to you, go look up Boppin' for MS-DOS, released 1994! His name is fucking Yeet!!
Anyway, this is a strange interdimensional being that can travel between game universes much like Čeda. And like Čeda, they can also throw blocks at you. They seem to be throwing blocks at Čeda in an attempt to solve a block-matching puzzle.
-
Bumbo
'Bum-bo want Coin'
Origin: The Legend of Bum-bo
Role: Bum

Bumbo wants coin, or at the very least golden teapots, sense that is the currency used here. He waits for his chance to attack by sometimes hiding in brick blocks. Once he is released from his hiding spot, he will quickly try to attack you, with each attack, not only do you get hurt, but he also takes your teapots as well, so watch your head.
-
Death Heads
'Death comes and goes'
Origin: Snoopy v1.0
Role: Death Giver

These are (mostly) indestructible skulls that constantly rise from the ground, or fall from the sky. Nobody knows why these even appear in such an environment, the rest of the snoopy v1.0 game is a sort of generic grasslands area with caterpillars and ladybugs. And then this thing shows up, and it's jarring, perhaps they were a part of hell before the meme took over?
Besides regularly hosting gladiatorial battles in a small brick-wall arena, nobody really know much else about them, not even how there is a seemingly infinite supply of them coming from above or below. A common misconception is that they simply loop back around in an endless cycle, but thorough examination has revealed that each skull has little differences and imperfections between each other, and there never seems to be a consistent pattern. If they truly did loop back around, the same skulls would come back around in the same order, but that never seems to happen.
-
Gopniks
'Hooligans'
Origin: Real Life
Role: Gopnik

Rogue delinquent slav, much like Čeda himself. They attack by holing up a slav cannon with their bare hands, in an attempt to make shooting water cooler bottles at his enemies more effective. They seem to also posses the uncanny ability to jump, scientists have examined this phenomena and have concluded that they seem to follow the actions of other gopniks. Hence why whenever Čeda jumps, all nearby gopniks also jump at the same time.
Their favourite food is green peas stew.
-
Space Chickens
'Solar System Invaders'
Origin: Chicken Invaders
Role: Aerial Strike

Interstellar creatures sent from the Mother-hen ship to take over the solar system, as revenge against humans. Last time I checked, Čeda is (mostly) a human boy, so the chickens will attempt to destroy him.
It is believed that the Hades Government has teamed up with the Mother-hen Ship to put a stop to Čeda's raid. In Exchange for the Space chickens efforts, the Hades Government has promised to repair and maintain the Mother-hen Ship in case of attacks from invaders looking to destroy it and eat chicken.

Bloodbug
'Hyper-Realistic Garbage'
Origin: Bone.exe
Role: AOE Attack

Another mutation of the Trashbug, this one has evolved to be a blood bag rather than a garbage bag due to it's spooky creepypasta-esque surroundings. When stomped on, all the blood in it is squeezed out, spilling blood all over the floor and making a big mess that ruin's peoples shoes.
The blood puddle it leaves seems to hurt Čeda specifically. Even though he's no stranger to blood, the creep it leaves behind seems to be painful to him, for whatever reason. Perhaps the blood contains something that hurts Čeda, but we never even knew Čeda has specific weaknesses that don't effect anyone else. Maybe it contains a sort of kryptonite for super beings.

C-Moon
'Master of Gravity'
Origin: jojo
Role: Path Blocking

Think you can get away from your enemies by flipping gravity? Well you can, but sometimes C Moon will pay you a visit. With his ability to flip his own gravity at will, he can track down Čeda, no matter what direction he's falling in. He is immune to being stomped on. People have theorized that he is made of cheese, just like real moons. For further evidence, these people like to point out that the C in C-Moon could stand for "Cheese". This is very unlikely considering he can still die from cheese attacks.
Nobody has been able to find the puppet master that controls this enemy, then again we didn't really try very hard to find him anyway.

Evil Otto
'Berserker'
Origin: Berzerk
Role: Hopper

A fairly deadly video game enemy like any other, it bounces towards you in an attempt to kill you. However, the arcade era of video games was a long time ago and he's gotten rusty, for one thing he can die now, also he's in a side-scrolling platformer as opposed to a top down shooter. What We're trying to say is that Evil Otto has not aged well, which is his undoing.

Princess
'Faceless Mysteries'
Origin: 'the
Role: God

A corrupted and spooky member of the royal family. She will orbit her prey and throw her own head at them. She also likes to put her victims in neverending loops, they can only escape by solving the stage's puzzle. Her true identity is shrouded in mystery and cryptic hints, or it's scientific term: "Spooky ARG Bullshit".
It is suspected that the Princess was hired by Lizard man himself to thwart Čeda's progress, and he paid her with the World's first Stickman. Which is fucking ridiculous, Lizard man would never sell the World's First Stickman. In conclusion, it is very unlikely that this political leader is secretly conducting business with lizard people.
She also said that she "Believes to be the God of this forest", at least we think she said that, the voice that spoke that line came from every direction.

Burger
'Slapstick Surprise'
Origin: Stick Figures on Crack 3
Role: Ground (Beef) Hazard

Gigantic hamburgers from the sky made for the sole purpose of humorously crushing stick figures. Over the years, they have gotten less accurate and are fairly easily baited into falling on you prematurely. However, because of this exploit, it changed it's strategy, and it will now go back to the top where it was previously before attempting to crush you again. Fortunately, it goes back up pretty slowly, so it gives you more time to escape it. The stickmen also fear this big burger for obvious reasons, seriously though, why do food and drinks keep killing the stick figures. In fact, why is food so deadly here anyway, is this part of hell supposed to punish the gluttonous or something?
-
Stick Figure
'Slapstick Victims'
Origin: PivotMasterDX
Role: Path Blocking

Some stickmen have survived being killed by hamburgers, off-screen props and weaponry by just being very hard to hit. They achieve this by going on a pogo stick and bouncing. They are also able to match Čeda's jump height exactly, making them hard to get through.
They seem to be afraid of flaming coca cola cans, locals theorize it gives them PTSD flashbacks of Fanta drinks. Further research shows history of harassment from multi-colored StickWomen. Though, we're pretty sure it's because they're regularly crushed by giant soda cans.
Historians have recently discovered that these Stick Figures have evolved from demented cartoon movies, this would exlpains the frequent deaths via slapstick. On a different note: Some Stick Figures in the Flash Lands are even capable of breaking the forth wall and will fight against their creators, fighting their animator's tools and creations while ruining their whole desktop.

Aliens
'Desktop Terrors'
Origin: Desktop Wars 2
Role: Attack from Above

These hovering stick creatures are deadly foes that track Čeda's position and fires a laser that could either hurt you or terraform the very ground you walk on. However, they seem to be a computer virus of sorts, although I'm pretty sure you can't just go to internet options and delete a virus by deleting your internet history, but that method seems to work with them. It's just too bad you don't have access to that option, so you have to deal with them manually.

Shadow Man
'Deadly Dark Figure'
Origin: Poor 4
Role: Knife Thrower

Lives in a Dark Caravan,
Uses an L Knife the same as you can,
He's Shadow Maaaaan.
-
Mothman
'Undefined and Persistent'
Origin: GTA Myth: Case 9
Role: Stage Hazard

Mysterious black objects in the skies of San Andreas are fairly rare, but the rarest of all is the mythical Mothman. A not at all moth looking creature that will stay in the sky, and then swoop down to hit Čeda when the time is right. It's strange form is certainly a point of debate, looking very unusual and certainly nothing like a moth. Some say that it could be the game's UI glitching out, because this is becoming kind of a bloated game at this point.
-
Alex Mercer
'Killer, monster, terrorist, all of the above'
Origin: [PROTOTYPE]
Role: Path Blocking

Alex is some kind of infected guy who can shapeshift his arm into a blade, he spends most of his days in a ruined New York, slicing and dicing innocent people, soldiers, and other infected beings. He was sent to hell due to his recklessness and disregard for human life, just like Čeda. And like Čeda, he is also able use his blade arm to perform spin attacks in the same time as Čeda. With Čeda and Mercer deflecting each others spin attacks, the two killers are unable to murder each other. The only way to end this conflict is for one of them to die through other means.

Purple Haze
'Death by Exposure'
Origin: jojo
Role: AOE Hazard

A mysterious spirit summoned by the Fugos as their secret power. Despite it looking pretty unstable, it tends to just float in air in a predictable pattern, The real danger is the purple mist it emits as it travels, if one stays too long in this mist, it will hurt them, and even kill them if they're weak. Cheese also evaporates as soon as they come in contact with the mist, making it somewhat impossible to kill them without blade related powerups.
-
Counter-Terrorists
'Last Line of Defence'
Origin: Counter-Strike
Role: Defence

Soldiers trained to defend and protect areas they are in. Besides being able to move and jump strategically, they can also throw their own knives at you, which boomerang back to them, so be careful how you dodge their attacks.
Coming from the arid deserts of de_dust2, these soldiers are used in desperate measures to defend the very last layer of Mega Satan's defence. Though it's not the only place they show up, as they also defend areas that may be even more important.

Golden Tea Pots
'Current Currency'
Origin: Original
Role: Currency

Golden Tea Pots are the main form of currency in Meme Hell. If that first sentence alone made you groan, then we'll tell you right now it's not gonna get much better than that. This item can be used to buy a whopping 2 things from the shop back in Čeda's compartment. However if you collect 100 golden tea pots, you get an extra life, as if we don't give you enough of those. At least the shop's straightforward and not something weird like paying lives to start with a powerup, that's kinda bizarre.

Golden Tea Pots in hell used to be regular coins like any other, and hell has a lot of coins to boot. But coins in particular seem to be very vulnerable to the meme disease, practically making it one of the first things to get infected. It is theorised by hell scientists that the meme diseases rapid spread was made even faster with the help of the Golden Tea Pots, due to them being everywhere and easily infected.
-
Golden Sausages
'Collectable Cuisine'
Origin: Golden Cow
Role: Special Currency

A common collectable in most stages. There's always 3 in every non-boss stage, but they can sometimes be well hidden. Superbeings consider Golden Sausages to be a status of wealth, and are used in trading.

They were created by a demi-superbeing named Murmillo, they are considered the world's first side activity, as before then people would only focus on their primary goals and never get distracted.
-
Flaming Coca Cola
'Hmmm, First Aid'
Origin: Poor 4
Role: Power-up

Not to be confused with Flaming Coca Cola Cans, which are ammunition for the flaming coca cola cannon that Andre uses. This hot drink is so hot that only super beings are able to consume it and use it's powers. Once consumed, it'll transform Čeda into a taller, less vulnerable form, in which he is not only able to take a hit without dying, but it also comes with such luxuries such as, being able to break blocks and jump ever so slightly higher.
-
Spooky Pepper Shaker
'Why a Pepper Shaker??'
Origin: ???
Role: Combat Power-up

If you read that name and thought to yourself: "That's the stupidest shit I've ever heard", Don't worry, we don't get it either, and at this point we're too afraid to change it into something that makes sense. This powerup allows Čeda to fire deadly cheese wheels from his hands, these cheese balls bounce until it hits an enemy or wall. However, this power is not the most useful against foes that have a way of defending themselves. In general, it seems that in hell, Cheese = Fire. So it's best to avoid any cheese related obstacles as well as fire ones.
-
Floppy Disc
'Dated Data Storage'
Origin: The 70s
Role: Information Storage

A very old form of storing data, but so annoying and difficult to use for that purpose that it was banished to hell. However, Klempodrome knows how to be resourceful and still finds a use for them. If you find 2 of them, it's just enough data to save the game. You may be asking "Wow, Why not just save the game at any time, this seems very archaic and arbitrary." To which we say: "No you don't get it, man. It's, like, important for level exploration 'n' stuff." we said, not knowing what we're talking about.

1up (Tiny Čeda)
'Save those fuckers up'
Origin: Original
Role: Life Savers

Extra Čeda, with this extra Čeda in your possession, you can die one more time. Which is good, because if you die, you're sent to the last point you saved, and god knows when that was. So you better stock up on Lives or stock up on Floppy Discs, if you don't want to find yourself redoing a bunch of stages, oh the horror.
-
Axe Transformation
'Spin to Slice'
Origin: Original
Role: Combat Power-up

Čeda's personal favourite powerup, it's both deadly and common enough to be a weapon of choice for most. Though while powerful, its downside is that it's the only offensive powerup that is not ranged in any way, making it the choice weapon for those who like their combat in close quarters. Though using its regular spin attack could be a pace breaker, the secondary airdash attack is perfect for those who like to keep up the pace.
-
Halva
'Sugar Rush'
Origin: Real Life
Role: Candy

A real sugar rush for any slav. The condensed Semicki and Sugar is so rich in (cheap) sugary goodness that it makes any slav superbeing go nuts, allowing them to murder most things in their path by just touching them. However the effects are eventually worn off, so savour the moment whenever you can.
-
Burek Cape
'Not so Light Breakfast'
Origin: Real Life
Role: Navigation Power-up

Delicious Cheburek, filled with the finest serbian mixed minced meat. It gives Čeda the ability to airdash upwards at an angle, letting you take shortcuts through some platforming challenges, and find some secrets you can only find with the cape. The only issue is that knowing where you'll land is even less predictable now, however it's somewhat mitigated by the ability to glide, which lets you control your landing a little more, but it's also just in general handy for sticking the landing in even regular jumps, due to Čeda being able to fall slowly with the glide function.
The Burek Cape was created by an ancient demi-superbeing called Burek Ceama. He invented it out of necessity, because there was a great cliff no one was able to cross, only falling into a cold puddle. And so the Burek Cape was invented, letting people easily cross large gaps. 
-
CS:GO Knife
'Long Range Melee Weapon'
Origin: CS:GO
Role: Combat Power-up

Not quite a Counter Strike 1.6 knife, but it certainly gets the job done. This knife is a very powerful blade, able to pierce through enemy defences and even the very ground you stand on. With the ability to shoot 2 boomeranging knives at a time, it's quite the powerful item when found. However, it is very rare, and at times even hidden, so it's best if you save it if you can.
-
Garlic Cola
'Cursed Drink'
Origin: The Internet
Role: Power-down

Oh god what the fuck is that!? That's disgusting, man! This uh... powerup? Well, no it's more of a powerdown. No matter the state you're in, this item will turn you back to your small vulnerable state. However, this may be useful in some situations, namely the small springs, which don't bounce anything if the person on them is too heavy.
-
Level Warp
'Level Leaper'
Origin: DX Ball
Role: Level Skipping Device

A powerful artefact from a breakout clone. It has the uncanny ability to skip levels, a very powerful ability in a game that's about beating levels to reach the ending. Unlike other items, this one can only be found in Čeda's apartment for 999 teapots, it is unknown how he came to the possession of this item beforehand or why he is selling it to himself. Don't count on seeing any of these in the wild, you'd have a better chance of finding Bigfoot.
-
L Knife
'Home made Power-up'
Origin: Poor 4
Role: Ultimate Weapon

Čeda's very own invention, it's a black knife, and he calls it L Knife. While a very simple invention, being a creation of a super being makes it a super knife. It's able to be thrown in an arc, and is able to kill anyone. ANYONE! (except for bosses, but that's just because they're higher, more powerful beings than Čeda.)
-
Slice of a Mysterious Apple
'Key Piece'
Origin: AGK Parodies
Role: Key

A slice of a Mysterious blue apple, brought to earth by extraterrestrial beings. If one eats all 4 slices, they are granted permanent access to the Meme Core, the source of the meme disease that's ravaging Hell. Each member of the Poor 4 has a slice of the apple, so getting them from the others should be a goal.
