[H,Čeda?] You can't pass this point.
[C,Čeda] Hey, what the fuck is going on<new line>here. I'm the only real Čeda!
[H,Čeda?] I only look like you<new line>because you're the only living<new line>thing in this void.
[C,Čeda] What fucking void<new line>are you talking about, bre?
The sign at the entrance said<new line>something about a tower.
[H,Čeda?] Well... it is not here,<new line>at least not yet.
[C,Čeda] And now you're fucking teasing<new line>me as well?
You are lucky I do not have<new line>machine gun with me.
Or the only thing left here<new line>would be a red puddle.
[H,Čeda?] Well that's too fucking bad<new line>for you, there is no tower here.
The other half of the world is<new line>not yet finished.
You are free to leave.
[C,Čeda] <shake>WHAT?!
I come all this way to become<new line>king of Counter Strike and<new line>this is what you give me?
A blank fucking void with<new line>no exit?
[H,Čeda?] For now, this is all there is.
Thanks for playing.
[C,Čeda] This is bullshit.<new line>Next time I come here you<new line>better not be here.
Or I will kill you --<new line>with or without machine gun.
