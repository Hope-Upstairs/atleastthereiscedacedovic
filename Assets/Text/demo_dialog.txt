[C,Čeda] Hey wait a minute, this isn't next level!
[D, Demo Man] That it isn't, lad.
I'm here to tell you that it's the end of the demo.
[C,Čeda] This is bullshit, when is full game gonna be made!
[D, Demo Man] Laddie, do I look like I have 2020 vision, I'm a bloody cyclops.
[C,Čeda] I'm so mad.
[D, Demo Man] But don't worry, the full game will be free too.
[C,Čeda] I was going to pirate it anyway.
[D, Demo Man] I'm a pirate sometimes too, ya know.
[C,Čeda] So what the fuck do I do now?
[D, Demo Man] You can just pause and exit to the map or exit the game.
[C,Čeda] I don't have no other fucking choice I guess.
