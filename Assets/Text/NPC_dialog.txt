I am going to conquer Hell and<new line>Counter Strike itself!
[1,Andre] Okay, but please bring back<new line>money, there is no food,<new line>if I can't eat food I will die.
[C,Čeda] Yes I know, I'll collect a<new line>few hundred <color red>golden teapots<color white><new line>on my way there.
I'm sure that's enough money<new line>to pay for shit.
[2,Miroslav] Here!<new line>Grab my <color red>mixtape<color white>!<new line>For Luck!

[C,Čeda] Good! Our trip to hell will be<new line>much quicker now!
[K,Klempodrome] I will be driving you<new line>between "worlds"...
Though I cannot skip these<new line>worlds until defeat<new line>the Boss of that world.
That way I can drive you<new line>all there safely.
[C,Čeda] Okay, I guess it won't be<new line>as fast as I thought.
[K,Klempodrome] I've also found this<new line><color red>Floppy Drive<color white>. I can use this<new line>to save your progress.
That way you don't have to go through the whole journey<new line>in one sitting.
[C,Čeda] What does "in one sitting"<new line>mean?
[K,Klempodrome] I don't know, I just heard that phrase somewhere.
Anyway, If you want your<new line>game saved, you'll have to<new line>find <color red>2 Floppy Disks<color white>.
That should be plenty of disk<new line>space to save all this data.<event>
[K,Klempodrome] So, are you ready to begin<new line>the journey?<options>
Ofcorse, bre! There is nothing to fucking do here.|Jebote, I haven't prepared yet.

[C,Čeda] Why isn't everything on fire?<new line>Where's the sounds of<new line>human agony, bre?
[B,Bear] Oh right, that was the case<new line>3 years ago, but then the meme took over.
[C,Čeda] The meme? Is this...<new line>meme what is causing hell<new line>to be not hell?
[B,Bear] Basically, yeah.
[C,Čeda] Hmmm, I do not know how<new line>comfortable I am with becoming the ruler of hell...
...if this is what it became.
[B,Bear] I would have at least taken<new line>care of the bees had I<new line>not lost my machine gun.

[C,Čeda] Did you say more things to<new line>kill? Well when you put it<new line>that way, I'll be happy to go.
[H,Harold] Sweet, just keep in mind that<new line>in the tower it's a bit warmer<new line>than it is outside.
[H,Harold] So <color red>time will unfreeze<color white>,<new line>and you don't have much of it.
[C,Čeda] Yes yes, I don't care, there<new line>will be some kind of <color red>clock<new line>to extend time<color white> anyway.
[C,Čeda] There always is.
[H,Harold] One last thing you should<new line>remember:
[H,Harold] <color red>You can only jump through<new line>stone platforms<color white>.
[C,Čeda] I do not know what the fuck<new line>that means.


Disco Dave

[D,Disco Dave] What's goin' on?
