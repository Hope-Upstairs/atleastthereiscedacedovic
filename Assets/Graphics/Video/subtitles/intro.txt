This is a story about Čeda.
A little gopnik boy, that enjoyed
Killing,
Killing, bloodshed
Killing, bloodshed and Wars.
He and his 3 friends are SUPER BEINGS.
Named The Poor 4(TM)
The worst team of super heroes in this world!
In comes Čeda one day
and thinks to himself:
Čeda: I haven't done anything awful recently...
Čeda: What do I do?
Čeda: What land will I conquer?
He then thought and thought
For years to decades to centuries
about what he'll do today.
Until finally, it came to him:
Čeda: I shall become the king of Counter-Strike!
He shouted so loud that his friends came to him and asked:
Miroslav: Why you gotta be so loud, bre?
Čeda: Shut your mouth.
Čeda: I have idea. For what we can do.
They gathered in one place, and Čeda spoke again:
Čeda: Today I have chosen to become the rightful King of Counter-Strike.
Djole: But how will you do that?
Asked Djole, to which Čeda responds:
Čeda: Easy, I will go to hell and kill its King.
Čeda: Man who rules Hell, rules Counter-Strike.
Čeda: It is a very common knowledge, you see.
Andre then belched something that not even I can understand.
But Čeda still responded by saying:
Čeda: Clearly, what we need to do, is get man to drive us to Hell.
Čeda: There are many Bus Stops in Hell...
Čeda: ...So we need bus driver.
Miroslav, with the power of Mir Man summons a being...
...from the Banished Realm.
THIS had many names, but people just called him
"Klempodrome"
Because it was funny.
The Poor 4 then asked the man to drive Čeda and the others to Hell!
Without hesitation, he used his Ninja Skills to...
...run off.
To the Bus Store and steal a bus.
Čeda, eagerly awaits to be transported to his favorite place in the whole world:
The source of all pain and suffering - Hell!
